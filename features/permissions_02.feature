Feature: Permissions
  As an user I want to have different permissions on resources
  So that I can decide who has what kind of access to my data

  As an owner of a Resource, I want to assign various permissions
  to users and groups.

    And There are "manage" user-permissions added for me to the resource
    And I visit the path of the resource
    And I open the edit-permissions dialog
    Then I am not the responsible person for that resource
